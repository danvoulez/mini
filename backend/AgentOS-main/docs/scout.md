# üïµÔ∏è AgentOS - Scout Agent

The Scout agent is the **watchdog** of the AgentOS ecosystem.  
It autonomously monitors the health of all other agents, logs activity, and generates intelligent reports using an LLM.

---

## Responsibilities

- Ping every agent via `/status` endpoint.
- Log results (`ok`, `fail`, `error`) with `loguru`.
- Generate markdown reports stored in `scout/reports/`.
- (Optionally) Suggest fixes, raise alerts or open GitHub PRs.
