# Memory Agent

The `memory` agent plays a vital role in the AgentOS ecosystem.  
It operates independently and communicates via API and shared memory.

---

## Responsibilities

Describe what the `memory` agent does in your system.
For example:
- Accepts inputs from other agents
- Processes memory-related tasks
- Interfaces with services like databases, APIs, or voice
