# AgentOS - Microcity of Autonomous Agents

AgentOS is a modular, multi-agent operating system designed for real-world execution of tasks across sales, memory, communication, voice, AI reasoning, file systems, and more.  
Built to function like a **city of agents**, each with a defined role, shared memory, and autonomy, the system is powered by OpenAI and inspired by cutting-edge agentic architectures.

---

## üöÄ Overview

AgentOS enables you to:
- Automate operations with modular agents (`scout`, `memory`, `voice`, `tool_proxy`, `vision`, `orchestrator`)
- Monitor and improve itself using the Scout auto-evaluator (LLM-based)
- Generate plugins, agents, workflows, and dashboards from natural language
- Connect to APIs, cloud storage, WhatsApp, Stripe, and more

## üåê Architecture (Fractal View)

Each service is its own micro-agent:

```
                 [ PromptOS ]
                      |
    +-----------------+-----------------+
    |         |        |        |       |
 [API]   [Memory]  [Vision] [Scout] [Voice]
                     |
                [Tool Proxy]
                     |
                [External APIs]
```

## üß† Core Agents

### `promptos/`
The natural-language interface and reasoning brain of the system. Turns ideas into working modules, triggers workflows, and guides users through installation and automation.

### `scout/`
Self-monitoring agent. Pings all other services, logs failures, and generates markdown health reports using an LLM.

### `memory/`
Handles persistent storage and cache. Connects with MongoDB and other sources to keep long-term memory for the system.

### `vision/`
Web-based vision interface that generates UIs and dashboards dynamically.

### `voice/`
Voice command interpreter and speaker. Integrated with Vox and other agents for full interaction loop.

### `orchestrator/`
Connects, routes, and prioritizes tasks between agents.

### `tool_proxy/`
Responsible for executing tools (browser, Python, uploads, etc.) with safety and rate limiting.

## üß† Philosophy

AgentOS treats software like a city:  
Each agent is a worker. Each memory is a story. Each tool is a hand.  
Your role? Be the mayor.
